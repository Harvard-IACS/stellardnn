                        <p>Neurodiffhub is a platform that uses neural networks to store and 
                            disseminate solutions to differential equations. 
                            It includes a web application that allows users to search for specific differential equation, 
                            and an API that can be used  to load and save solutions.
                            The platform aims to provide a central repository for 
                            solutions to differential equations and make it easier for researchers 
                            and practitioners to access and use these solutions in their work.

                        <h3>NeurodiffEq</h3>

                        <p> Differential equations occur in various scientific and 
                            engineering domains. Most differential equations of practical 
                            interest are analytically intractable. 
                            Traditionally, differential equations are solved by numerical methods. 
                            Neural networks have been proven to be universal function approximators, 
                            suggesting the possibility of using ANNs to solve differential equations. 
                            Given the interest,  it would be highly beneficial to have an 
                            easy-to-use software package that allows researchers to quickly set up 
                            and solve problems. NeurodiffEq is a library that will enable researchers 
                            to use NN to solve ODEs and PDEs.

                        <h2 class="h3 ">Astromer</h2>

                        <p>ASTROMER  is a transformer-based model to create representations of astronomical light curves. 
                            ASTROMER is pre-trained self-supervised using hundreds of millions of unlabeled light curves. 
                            The learned weights can be easily adapted to other data by re-training ASTROMER on the new sources. 
                            The power of ASTROMER consists in using the representation 
                            to extract light curve embeddings that can enhance the training of other models, 
                            such as classifiers or regressors. Using ASTROMER embeddings decreases 
                            the computational resources needed while achieving state-of-the-art results. 
                            A python library includes all the functionalities employed in this work.

                        <h3>Computer Vision methods for the Event Horizon Telescope</h3>

                        <p> In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration released the first-ever 
                            image of the M87* 
                            supermassive black hole. Accurate parameterization of images like this 
                            can provide new information 
                            regarding the dynamics of matter close to a black hole. 
                            Moreover, it can enable us to test theories of gravity 
                            and deepen our understanding of the magnetized relativistic 
                            jets created by the blackhole. 
                            In these projects, we deploy deep learning, to parameterize and estimate the 
                            physical parameters of M87*.   </p>

                        <h3>Reservoid Computing</h3>

                        <p>Reservoir computers (RCs) are among the fastest to train of all neural networks, 
                            especially when compared to other recurrent neural networks. 
                            RC has this advantage while still handling sequential data exceptionally well. 
                            However, RC adoption has lagged other neural network models because of the model's 
                            sensitivity to its hyper-parameters (HPs).
                            We developed \rctorch, a \pytorch based RC neural network package with automated HP tuning. 
                            In addition, we introduce an unsupervised reservoir computing (RC), capable of discovering 
                            approximate solutions that satisfy ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

                        <p>The field of machine learning has drawn increasing interest from various fields due to its methods' 
                            success in solving many different problems. An application of these has been to train artificial neural 
                            networks to solve differential equations without needing a numerical solver. In these works, we use 
                            artificial neural networks to represent solutions of the differential equations that govern the 
                            background dynamics of the Universe for four different models. We have applied these methods to various models such as the  $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, a quintessence model with exponential potential, and the Hu-Sawicki $f\left(R\right)$ model. 
                            We used the networks' solutions to perform statistical analyses to estimate the values of 
                            each model's parameters with observational data. Additionally, we use similar methods for holographic 
                            calculation of the bubble wall velocity in a cosmological phase transition, which is crucial to determine 
                            the resulting spectrum of GWs. </p>

                             ADS maintains three bibliographic collections containing more than 15 million records covering 
                             publications in astronomy and astrophysics, physics, and general science, including all arXiv e-prints. 
                             The abstracts and full text of major astronomy and physics publications are indexed and searchable. 
                             At ADS ML, we are applying modern machine learning and natural language processing techniques to 
                             the ADS dataset to train astroBERT, a deeply contextual language model based on research at Google.
                              Using astroBERT, we aim to enrich the ADS dataset and improve its discoverability; in particular,
